# electronEncryptor
This program can encrypt text in hash (static key; will be updated to allow custom keys) as well as decrypt them. It can also convert normal text into l337 sp34k if you're into that in which case I'm sorry for you.

P.S. Github won't let me upload my folders so I just zipped them. just unzip them when you clone the repo.
